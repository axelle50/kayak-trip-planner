### Objective
Imagine working for Kayak: <br />
The goal of this project is to help users plan a one week trip. 
- It takes weather into account for the 27 best cities to visit in France and recommands the top 5 cities for next week. 
- It shows the user a list of the 20 best hostels in thoses cities, according to Booking.com ranking.
- Store everything in a data lake.

### We will use
- APIs to determine cities coordinates and weather.
- Scrap Booking.com for hostels.
- AWS S3 to store these results.

## Dataset
There is no dataset as the objective is to gather data from scraping and APIs.

## Prerequisites

### Dependencies
- The source code is written in Python 3.
- The python packages can be installed with pip : `pip3 install -R requirements.txt`

## Usage
### Run the file linearly
Note that you should use your own API keys for openweathermap and AWS S3.
